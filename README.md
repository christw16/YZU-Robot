# YZU-Robot

This YZUEI Robot is our graduate capstone. The group members are Li-Yuan Liu and Ching-Hsien Hsu.



Generally, a defined biped humanoid robot has a torso, a head, two arms, as well as two legs. The robot requires a combination of hardware and software knowledge, integrating the expertise of the electrical, mechanical, and software knowledge. It is the best learning element for interdisciplinary learning. In this capstone, we use deep learning approach to combine with the robot. We use state of the art object detection method - YOLO to detect our custom trained object......to be continue



We can design the robot with our need. This robot is bought from Robosmart Technology. It provides us an opportunity to build our own robot!
