# YOLO training
In this part we will talk about our training process and result.

### Second step training(10/15)
&emsp; In previous step we just collect the image from front side, so we decide to collect the dataset from back side.
&emsp; We use same strategy to collect the data, but this time we also add the different angle dataset.
&nbsp;
&emsp; We test the data from 90 degree, 45 degree, front side and back side. The result show below.

Distance = 55 cm(90°):

Distance = 42 cm(90°):

Distance = 26 cm(90°):  

Distance = 55 cm(45°):

Distance = 42 cm(45°):

Distance = 26 cm(45°):

Distance = 55 cm(90°) Back side:

Distance = 42 cm(90°) Back side:

Distance = 26 cm(90°) Back side:

Distance = 55 cm(45°) Back side:

Distance = 42 cm(45°) Back side:

Distance = 26 cm(45°) Back side:
